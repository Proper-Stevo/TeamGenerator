## Installation

Through this development we used Inquirer, used packages that helped convert raw data into what you get to see in the screen.                                                                                                                     

## Credits

This was a big project that I was really stuck with, I was fourtunate to have all my classmates and my teachers, tutors and TA's. 
Special shoutout to https://github.com/cindyung56 for helping with the structure of my page. 
And especially my favorite tutor so far @@DavidJohnson, hes instructions are so clear and they help me when im studying, he doesn't give me the answer, he leads me so I can figure it out myself. This was the most difficult project thus far, extremely greateful for all the resources.
